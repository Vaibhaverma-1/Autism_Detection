## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build a Logistic Regression model for binary classification. We start with a baseline model and then use hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to improve model performance. The model's accuracy is compared, and the most important features are visualized to understand the decision-making process.

## Installation Instructions
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
These dependencies are required for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset consists of multiple features, and the following steps were taken for preprocessing:

Missing Values: Any missing values were handled appropriately.

Feature Encoding: Categorical features were encoded into numeric values.

Feature Scaling: The features were scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data.

Train-Test Split: The data was split into training and test sets to evaluate the model performance.

Model Building
We started by building a baseline Logistic Regression model. This was done using the LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize the model, we used GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning. The parameters tuned include:

C: Regularization strength

penalty: The type of regularization ('l2')

solver: Solvers ('newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear')

max_iter: The maximum number of iterations for optimization

class_weight: Whether to apply class weights

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'C': [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000],
    'penalty': ['l2'],
    'solver': ['newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear'],
    'max_iter': [100, 200, 300, 500],
    'class_weight': [None, 'balanced']
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(), param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation
After tuning the hyperparameters, we evaluated both the baseline and tuned models. The evaluation was done using the following steps:

Accuracy Score: The accuracy was calculated for both models.

ROC Curve: The ROC curve was plotted to visualize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate at various thresholds.

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_curve, auc

# Evaluate Baseline Model
baseline_y_pred = baseline_model.predict(X_test)
baseline_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, baseline_y_pred)

# Evaluate Tuned Model
tuned_y_pred = tuned_model.predict(X_test)
tuned_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, tuned_y_pred)
Feature Importance
We used the coefficients from the Logistic Regression model to visualize the feature importance. This helps us understand which features are most influential in predicting the target variable.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

feature_importance = tuned_model.coef_[0]
features = X.columns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(features, feature_importance)
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
plt.ylabel('Feature')
plt.title('Feature Importance for Logistic Regression')
plt.show()
Plotting
The following plots were created to visualize the performance of the model:

Accuracy Comparison: A bar plot comparing the accuracy of the baseline and tuned models.

ROC Curve: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to show the performance of the model.

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Accuracy comparison
accuracy_comparison = {
    'Baseline Model': baseline_accuracy,
    'Tuned Model': tuned_accuracy
}

sns.barplot(x=list(accuracy_comparison.keys()), y=list(accuracy_comparison.values()), palette='muted')
plt.title('Comparison of Baseline and Tuned Logistic Regression Model')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.show()

# ROC Curve
y_prob = grid_search.best_estimator_.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, y_prob)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='b', label=f'AUC = {roc_auc:.2f}')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='gray', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('ROC Curve')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show()
Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model was successfully built and tuned for improved accuracy. By applying hyperparameter tuning, we achieved a significant increase in performance compared to the baseline model. Feature importance analysis revealed which features had the most impact on the predictions. The model was evaluated using accuracy and ROC curve metrics, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.

Future Improvements
Advanced Models: Exploring other models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks could further improve performance.

Feature Engineering: Experimenting with additional features or creating new ones may help improve the model's predictive power.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Using methods like RandomizedSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization could lead to even better results.
